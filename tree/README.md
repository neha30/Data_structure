# Tree

Implementing binary tree and perform different operation in C, C++ and Python.

---> In most of the program we take input "total" and "r" where total will represent total number of nodes for creating binary tree and r is the range for node value.

---> In windows, you need to install GCC compiler. Easy way to install it is to install CodeBlocks IDE and set path to gcc in Windows Path variable.

---> Additional file for compliation and execution
       c++ ----> tree_utilities.cpp and tree_utilities.h
       
---> Download given respective files and keep them in a same folder as source file.

----> compilation and execution
   
   1) C++
      compilation (Ubuntu/Windows): g++ -o <object_file_name> <source_file_name> tree_utilities.cpp
      Runing (Ubuntu) : ./<object_file_name>
      Runing (Windows) : <object_file_name>.exe
      
      Example:
      In Ubuntu:
          $  g++ -o tree tree.cpp tree_utilities.cpp
          $  ./tree
